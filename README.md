This is an example of my coding quality level before any professional experience, and before understanding any clean code principles. Ideally I'd change the following:
- Rename variables to be more readable, and remove as many comments as possible
- Create my own classes for the grid structure to make it easier to get the information we need
- Restructure giant nested if-statement (which will be helped by changing the data type of the grid)
- Extract more helper methods to maintain the same level of abstraction in each method

When I have some spare time I'll make these changes myself. Thanks for taking a look at the very beginning of my coding journey!
